# cbor-redux

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) data format
([RFC 7049](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) implemented in pure JavaScript
with an API surface like the built-in JSON functions. Rewritten in TypeScript
for the browser, Deno, and Node.

## Using CBOR

Like the JSON API, this library is synchronous. Simply import into your runtime:
Deno, browser, Node ESM, or Node CommonJS. Browser imports can be handled via
your favorite bundler, or using Skypack CDN.

```TypeScript
// This is an example Deno import statement.
import { CBOR } from "https://deno.land/x/cbor_redux@1.0.0/mod.ts";

const initial = { Hello: "World", how: "are you?" };
const encoded = CBOR.encode(initial, ["Hello"]);
const decoded = CBOR.decode(encoded);
console.log(decoded); // Output: { Hello: "World" }
```

Unrecognized CBOR tags will be emitted as instances of `TaggedValue`, allowing
an application to use custom handling. Simple values in CBOR that are reserved
or unassigned will be emitted as instances of `SimpleValue` so that they may be
handled directly.

For users who need more power and control, the entire library API is documented
at
[doc.deno.land](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/x/cbor_redux@1.0.0/mod.ts).

## Supported Features

- Concise Binary Object Representation
  ([RFC 7049](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7049), partial RFC 8949, see
  below)
- Proper support for large integers; integers larger than a JavaScript `number`
  may safely hold will be decoded as `bigint`. Values of `bigint` will be
  encoded when provided by the application.
- Typed Arrays ([RFC 8746](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8746.html))
- Tags ([RFC 8949](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml))
- Simple Values
  ([RFC 8949](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-simple-values/cbor-simple-values.xhtml))
- Rejection with `mode: 'strict'` of duplicate keys in key/value dictionaries
  ([RFC 8152](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8152.html#section-14))
- [Preferred serialization](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#preferred)

### Planned features from [RFC 8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-changes-from-rfc-7049)

These are not yet supported, but are planned for the version 1.0.0 major
release.

- Implement "deterministic encoding" per
  [spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#core-det)
- CBOR Sequences ([RFC 8742](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8742.html))

## Contributing code and issues

### Issues

Please report bugs! I maintain this library in my free time, so please do not
expect immediate turn-around for your bug.

Feel free to drop an issue abotu a missing feature of CBOR. Please reference the
appropriate RFC number and explain how you believe the library should behave.

No matter why you're opening an issue, please provide:

- The environment OS
- The JavaScript runtime, and version
- An example working piece of code that reproduces your issue.

### Code

This project accepts pull requests! If you have a fix for a bug or an
implementation of a CBOR feature, bring it. You'll be credited here in the
readme.

Ground rules:

1. Please adhere to the
   [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)
2. Use vanilla TypeScript; no explicit Node, Deno, or browser references
   permitted except for tests
3. Reference an open issue; if one does not exist, please create one

If you have a history of commits and would like maintianer status to help triage
issues and deploy code faster, please open an issue requesting access. Don't be
put off by the fact that this codebase targets Deno. It is compiled and released
for browser and Node; Deno is not a hard prerequisite for contributing (but it
does help).
